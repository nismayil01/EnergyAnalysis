# Energy Analysis
The increase in global warming and CO2 emissions over the past century has led us to 
adapt and utilize renewable energy and replace the conventional fossil fuels. To understand the 
effect of the renewable energy adaptation over the fossil fuels, it is crucial to examine the pattern 
over the last two decades and investigate whether the utilization of renewable energies have led 
to decrease in CO2 emission or not and thus, have any effect on the global warming. It is also 
useful to understand what is the current stage of adaptation of the renewables over fossil fuels in 
various countries.
This problem will be explored using a global sustainable energy dataset that covers 
electricity and energy consumption attributes per year for each country from 2000-2022. To
investigate the global patterns, this study uses Python, Arcpy module. The pattern will be 
analyzed using different plots, global maps and correlation graphs between various factors.
